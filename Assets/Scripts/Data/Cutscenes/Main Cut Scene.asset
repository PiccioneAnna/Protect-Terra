  - "The planet we\u2019re going to has been suffering for ages from pollution."
  - "We\u2019re going to try to clean it up, but we will need time and resources. "

  - "I\u2019m going to need to be planted somewhere in the environment in order to
    gain intelligence on the local ecosystem."
  - As my physical form will be enmeshed into the environment, I will be heavily
    vulnerable to corruption.
